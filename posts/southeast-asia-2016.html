                        <p>This wasn&#8217;t our first trip to Asia but it was our first trip for vacation purposes.
                            CMac and GMac have spent time in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for business purposes
                            so we had a taste of Asian travel before this trip. However, our experiences on this trip
                            were different that what we had experienced previously. This trip was one of our most
                            memorable and left us wanting to go back and explore the region in more depth. The sights,
                            food and experiences were all fantastic and very economical by western standards. </p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Itinerary and Getting There</h2>



                        <p>We were travelling to the other side of the world so we wanted to make sure we had enough
                            time on the ground to make the travel worth it. Therefore this trip spanned three weeks over
                            the Christmas/New Year holidays. We travelled before Christmas and returned in the second
                            week of January. Getting there was fairly easy, although it was the longest flights to date
                            for our kids. We flew through Hong Kong to get to Bangkok. On the way back we flew out of Ho
                            Chi Minh City to Shanghai and then home from there. Our itinerary included stops in
                            Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>



                        <ul class="wp-block-list">
                            <li>Bangkok, Thailand &#8211; 3 days to acclimatize and see the city</li>
                            <li>Siem Reap, Cambodia &#8211; 4 days to explore Angkor Watt</li>
                            <li>Phu Quoc, Vietnam &#8211; 3 days of beach time over Christmas</li>
                            <li>Phong Nha National Park, Vietnam &#8211; 3 days to explore the park and amazing caves
                            </li>
                            <li>Hoi An, Vietnam &#8211; 3 days to explore</li>
                            <li>Ho Chi Minh City &#8211; 3 days to explore and wrap up the trip</li>
                        </ul>



                        <p>We were moving around quite a bit on this trip and used a variety of transportation including
                            buses, taxis and planes. We could book in country flights reasonably close to travel dates
                            with no cost penalties which was nice. Our most memorable travel segment was going from
                            Bangkok to Siem Reap via bus. The bus was quite comfortable but during the trip we crossed
                            the the border into Cambodia. The border crossing was quite the experience and we got to see
                            a wide variety of vehicles cross with all manners of cargo.</p>



                        <p>For accommodations the one that stood out for us on this trip was the <em><a

                            It was rustic and featured a common room where we meet fellow travellers exploring the area.
                            Other than the farmstay our accomodations were good but nothing to call out.</p>



                        <p></p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bangkok</h2>



                        <p>We had heard a lot of great things about Bangkok and were looking forward to exploring the
                            city. We also wanted to spend a few low key days to acclimatize to the time change,
                            especially for the kids who would be experiencing a 13 hour time change for the first time.
                            We enjoyed our time in the city, there are some good tourist sites and some interesting
                            markets and neighbourhoods. However, the city didn&#8217;t wow us which just reinforced our
                            travel preferences on cities &#8211; they&#8217;re fine but don&#8217;t spend more than 3
                            days in one. Some of the sights we enjoyed while in the city included:</p>



                        <ul class="wp-block-list">
                            <li>Grand Palace &#8211; Some historical artifacts and includes the temple of the emerald
                                buddha</li>
                            <li>Wat Pho &#8211; Temple of the giant buddha</li>
                            <li>Chatuchak Market &#8211; Market with a variety of stalls and goods. We got foot massages
                                here which we really enjoyed as a novelty.</li>
                            <li>Khao San Road &#8211; Well known backpacker road with some cool cafes.</li>
                        </ul>



                        <p>Other sites or guidebooks will have better description of the sites. </p>

                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Siem Reap &#8211; Angkor Wat</h2>



                        <p>We didn&#8217;t know much about Angkor Wat before researching this trip but it&#8217;s a
                            can&#8217;t miss sight if you&#8217;re in Cambodia. Angkor Wat is a massive temple complex
                            outside the city of SIEM reap. We were amazed at the sheer size of the complex and state of
                            the ruins. It is one of the most impressive ruins we&#8217;ve toured in the world and it
                            will take you several days to explore. Angkor Wat is the main and best preserved temple in
                            the area but there are many others. The main temple complex is orientated so that the sun
                            rises over it. The temple area is very crowded in the morning as tourists flock to the site
                            to capture the sun rise. You can spend a full day exploring the ruins</p>



                        <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async"
                                src="https://i0.wp.com/themacsabroad.kgl.kdr.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_2885.jpg?w=880&#038;ssl=1"

                        </figure>



                        <p>While Angkor Wat takes all of the headlines the area is filled with other temples. While not
                            as well preserved, the nearby temple complex of Angkor Thom is bigger and features the Bayon
                            Temple. Bayon is another well known temple with many intricate carvings. If you&#8217;ve
                            seen jungle temples in movies you might actually have seen Ta Prohm which is a temple
                            complex overgrown by trees. </p>



                        <div class="wp-block-image">
                            <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async"

                        </div>



                        <p>As you can likely tell already there are more than enough temples to explore in the area and
                            you&#8217;ll need a few days to fully explore the area. Admittedly by the end of three days
                            we were templed out.</p>



                        <p>We enjoyed our stay in the city of SIEM Reap. We had a comfortable hotel at reasonable rates
                            which provided a motobike rickshaw driver (Mr. Buffalo) who helped us get around. The center
                            of the city has a nice tourist area with restaurants and shops. We had some great meals in
                            the city.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Phu Quoc</h2>



                        <p>Since we were travelling over Christmas holidays we wanted to find a relaxing spot to spend a
                            few days on the beach and give the kids a different type of Christmas. We choose the island
                            of Phu Quoc. It was very laid back and had beautiful beaches with clear water. We enjoyed a
                            few days there relaxing and hanging out at the pool or the beach. If you&#8217;re looking
                            for some beach days it&#8217;s a good spot to visit.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Phong Nha</h2>



                        <p>This was on of the trip&#8217;s unexpected highlights. <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
                                href="https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/complete-guide-phong-nha"
                                target="_blank">Phong Nha</a> is a township in the North Central Coast Region of
                            Vietnam. It features the <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
                                href="https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/central-vietnam/phong-nha" data-type="URL"
                                data-id="https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/central-vietnam/phong-nha"
                                target="_blank">Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park</a> which was a hidden gem although we
                            suspect it will become very well known. We stayed at the <em><a
                                    href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g4014591-d1930272-Reviews-Phong_Nha_Farmstay-Phong_Nha_Ke_Bang_National_Park_Quang_Binh_Province.html">Phong
                                    Nha farmstay</a></em> mentioned above and while rustic we highly recommend it. </p>



                        <p>The park features the world&#8217;s largest caves that were created by millions of years of
                            flooding. There are a lot of caves there of all shapes and sizes. We loved our time there
                            and ended up hiking in caves, swimming in a cave, ziplining to a cave and taking a mudbath
                            in a cave. We were able to take a jungle hike that brought us to several large and deep
                            caves. This area suited our spirit for adventure and if there is one recommendation to take
                            away from the post go to Phong Nha before it becomes too touristy.</p>

                        <p>If you are planning to go to Phong Nha be aware that the caves flood during rainy season
                            which lasts from October to December. We visited just after rainy season.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hoi An</h2>



                        <p>Hoi An is a city in central Vietnam along the coast. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                            since 1999. It is known as a well preserved Southeat Asian trading port of the 15th and 19th
                            centuries. It features an array of architectural styles including Chinese temples, French
                            colonial buildings, Vietnamese tube houses and the Japanese Covered Bridge. </p>



                        <p>The old town while not large was very nice to wander in. The streets are narrow and
                            atmospheric. There are some nice shops and restaurants. We really enjoyed hanging out in the
                            area and spent time shopping, eating and hanging out in coffee shops.</p>



                        <p>If you&#8217;re looking for tailored clothes there are a number of shops in town that will
                            make custom suits, jackets, shirts or whatever you&#8217;d like. It doesn&#8217;t take long
                            but you&#8217;ll still need a few days. If you&#8217;re interested in tailored clothing come
                            with an idea of what you&#8217;d like and target some shops to visit. GMac purchased some
                            custom shirts and a suit. Both were of good quality and lasted several years. </p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)</h2>



                        <p>We book ended the trip at another city since we needed access to an international airport. We
                            also wanted a few easier days to wrap up the trip. Ho Chi Minh City was another Asian city
                            with a mix of areas, some modern and some not so much. We enjoyed our time there and if
                            you&#8217;re visiting make sure you take in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

                            War) from another perspective. </p>



                        <p>The other experience we had that was very memorable was a food tour on the back of scooters.
                            There were more scooters than we could count on the streets and we spent this tour on the
                            back of a scooter, driven by our guides, amongst the scooter masses. At one point we seemed
                            to lose daughter #1 as she disappeared with her guide to get dessert for the group. All was
                            fine in the end, just a parent scare for GMac and CMac. We ate some of the most amazing
                            foods in alleys and nooks on the tour. We would never have found the spots we were taken to
                            on our own. It was an awesome experience that we&#8217;d highly recommend. </p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magic Moment</h2>



                        <p>We took part in a guided jungle hike in <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
                                href="https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/central-vietnam/phong-nha" data-type="URL"
                                data-id="https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/central-vietnam/phong-nha"
                                target="_blank">Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park</a> which featured a set of massive
                            caves which are the signature feature of the park. There were so many unique moments on this
                            hike that included following a muddy trail through the jungle, hiking deep into a large cave
                            and swimming into a flooded cave and turning out our headlights once we were out of the
                            sunlight. This hike still stands out to us many years later, especially at the end where we
                            were tired but surrounded by jungle covered hills. </p>
