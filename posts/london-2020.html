                        <p>We both travel to London regularly for business so we try to add a couple of vacation days to
                            a business trip when our schedules align. It&#8217;s also one of our favourite international
                            cities. We&#8217;ll admit that it can be too busy and sometimes grungy but it the city
                            always feels alive to us. It&#8217;s easy to get around in for a city of it&#8217;s size
                            thanks to the Tube, Black Cabs and Ubers. It&#8217;s also very walkable which is our
                            preferred mode of transportation. We love the pubs on every corner, the shops and the wide
                            variety of food. </p>



                        <p>This trip was in January of 2020, before the world was turned on it&#8217;s head with
                            COVID-19. Both GMac and CMac had business meetings in the UK for the upcoming week and we
                            left on Friday to get a weekend away together before the business week started.</p>



                        <p>Each time we travel to London for pleasure we try to explore a different part of the city.
                        </p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting There</h2>



                        <p>We&#8217;re almost always coming into London via Heathrow airport. Occasionally we&#8217;ve
                            come in through Gatwick but that&#8217;s been the exception. It&#8217;s relatively easy to
                            get into the city from the airport and include your usually options of Black Cab/Uber or
                            public transportation. </p>



                        <ul class="wp-block-list">
                            <li>Black Cab/Uber &#8211; The most expensive option (<strong>£</strong>45<strong> &#8211;
                                    <strong>£</strong></strong>75) to get into the city but it can be the fastest point
                                to point. It&#8217;s more economical if you&#8217;re travelling with a group. </li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/#/">Heathrow Express</a> &#8211; Express train
                                from Heathrow to Paddington station, runs every 15mins. Approximately
                                (<strong>£</strong>37 round trip but fairs vary and are more expensive one way). More
                                economical for one than a Black Cab/Uber but more expensive than the Tube. It&#8217;s
                                really convenient if you&#8217;re staying around Paddington station but if not we
                                don&#8217;t find it any faster than the Tube on it&#8217;s own. </li>
                            <li><a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/">The Tube</a> &#8211; The Piccadilly line runs
                                from Heathrow into the heart of London. While there are a lot of stops along the way and
                                it can feel like a milk-run it&#8217;s very economical (<strong>£</strong>6 although can
                                be cheaper with Oyster card) and convenient for dropping you off in most locations in
                                the city.</li>
                        </ul>



                        <p>Over time we&#8217;ve gravitated toward the Tube as our preferred method of getting into the
                            city. It&#8217;s very reasonably priced and it&#8217;s been reliable for us.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accomodations</h2>



                        <p>We&#8217;re both <a href="https://www.marriott.com/loyalty.mi">Marriott rewards </a>members
                            and tend to stay in Marriotts for business travel. We like their hotels and there are
                            usually a range of options in the cities we&#8217;re travelling to. It&#8217;s helpful for
                            accumulating hotel points for use on vacations. For this trip we choose to stay in an area
                            of the city that we hadn&#8217;t spent much time in before &#8211; the south bank near
                            Waterloo station. We stayed at the <a
                                href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lonkb-bankside-hotel-autograph-collection/">Bankside
                                Hotel, Autograph Collection.</a> The hotel was excellent and we&#8217;d highly recommend
                            it. The room was modern and breakfasts in the morning were very good.</p>



                        <p>In other trips we&#8217;ve stayed in South Kensington, Westminster, Saint Pancreas and
                            Paddington. All of the locations we&#8217;ve stayed in offer good access to the city either
                            through the Tube or walking. We&#8217;ve stayed in South Kensington for the majority of
                            business trips because you can get some good deals on hotels in the area.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring the City</h2>



                        <p>Since we were on the South Bank we took the opportunity to explore the area around the hotel
                            in more depth. We spent much of the first day in London walking along the Thames along paths
                            and sidewalks. As with most areas in Londons there are lots of shops and pubs you can find
                            along your travels. The highlight of the day was the <a
                                href="https://boroughmarket.org.uk/">Borough Market</a> which we hadn&#8217;t previously
                            been aware of. It&#8217;s a warren of shops, mostly food related, that spans a few blocks.
                            We enjoyed wandering the area and tasting some of the foods in the market. The Bourough
                            Market is just south of London Bridge we walked across since we were in the area.</p>



                        <p>For the evening we stuck to the South bank and enjoyed some of the local pubs and a local
                            restaurant. Overall a great night. </p>

                        </div>



                        <p>On day 2 we decided to do what we normally do, just walk and explore. Since we had spent most
                            of day 1 on the South Bank we headed across the Blackfriar bridge and aimed ourselves for
                            the British Museum. London has some great museums but we&#8217;re not really museum people.
                            This day we felt we needed to hit one London tourist spot so we chose the British Museum. It
                            also gave us a good walking target for the day and brought us through Covent Garden. Covent
                            Garden is a spot we hit regularly while in London, it&#8217;s got a good selection of stores
                            for shopping along with restaurants or pubs. It&#8217;s fairly central so usually if
                            we&#8217;re walking above we&#8217;ll end up in Covent Garden at some point. If you&#8217;re
                            in London we recommend it.</p>



                        <p>We ended up at the British Museum around noon. As we mention above we not big museum people
                            and tend to try to hit the highlights when visiting. CMac says this is one of GMac&#8217;s
                            most appealing qualities. We were very thankful that the British Museum gives you a <a
                                href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/visit/object-trails/one-hour-museum">&#8216;highlight
                                tour&#8217;</a> and recommends 12 objects to see while in the museum. We jumped all over
                            that and made our way through the museum with efficiency in mind. Being fair to the museum,
                            it was well laid out and featured a great selection of historical artifacts. You really
                            could spend a full half or full day there if museums interest you. For us, an hour was good
                            and we left feeling like it was time well spent.</p>



                        <p>The British Museum was a good distance from our hotel so by the time we meandered back to our
                            hotel it was evening. We grabbed supper at a pub and had a quiet night. We had a week of
                            work ahead us with some travel in the UK so we needed to get ready. </p>
