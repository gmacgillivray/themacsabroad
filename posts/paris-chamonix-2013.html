<p>Paris and Chamonix was our first trip abroad as a family. CMac and GMac had previously travelled extensively in Europe for work so the destination, at least Paris, was familiar. However, it was our first step as a family into international travel. We were uncertain how the kids would handle this trip, they were 9 and 11, at the time but they did great. It was a very memorable trip for us as a family. It was also a little surprising since Chamonix exposed us to &#8216;mountain&#8217; vacations and we haven&#8217;t been the same since.  The time we spent in Chamonix eclipsed the wonders of Paris which we didn&#8217;t expect.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Planning</h2>



<p>The planning for this trip was simple at a high level. We didn&#8217;t want to be moving around with the kids too much since this was their first trip abroad. We would be in France for 2 weeks total and we divided that time evenly between Paris and Chamonix. We later refined our travel itineraries to spend less time in cities, as a rule of thumb we only spend about 3 days in any city. After 3 days we get tired of the city and generally find we can hit the highlights in 3 days. Travel in and out of France is easy, for this trip we flew into Paris and then out of Geneva since this was closer to Chamonix. Getting from Paris to Chamonix involved a train ride from Paris to Geneva airport where we would pick up a rental car to travel onto Chamonix.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Paris</h2>



<p>Paris is an amazing city and there are numerous guide books/websites for recommendations on where to go and what to see. I won&#8217;t claim to be an expert on the city and it&#8217;s been some time since we visited so I&#8217;ll keep this short with some tips/learnings on the city when visiting with pre-teen kids. </p>



<p>We budgeted 6 days in the city to spend with the kids. In retrospect this was too long for us but wanted time for the kids to adjust to the time change and not have overloaded days. We aimed to hit one major tourist site a day and then leave the rest of the day to either wander or relax depending on how the kids were doing. Tips/learnings below:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Louvre &#8211; One of the premier museums in the world and well worth the visit. Most days of the week the museum closes at 6pm but on one day it&#8217;s open until 9:45pm. The museum is less busy on the day it&#8217;s open late. We spent about 2 hours on that evening in the museum and had to deal with smaller crowds. We were easily able to get up front with an unobstructed view of the Mona Lisa.</li>



<li>Museum D&#8217;Orsay &#8211; Our favourite museum in Paris which features a rich collection from the impressionists. The setting is an old train station. Must see for us, even on return visits.</li>



<li>Rodin Museum &#8211; Smaller in scope and a quicker visit. We were impressed by Rodin&#8217;s work.</li>



<li>Palace of Versailles &#8211; Requires a train ride outside of Paris on the RER C line. We enjoyed the Palace and the grounds since we could not only see the size and grandeur of the Palace but also spend some time in the gardens with the kids.</li>



<li>Eiffel Tower &#8211; Another must see, elevators might be easier with the kids but we also found the stairs enjoyable.</li>



<li>Montmarte &amp; <strong>Sacré-Cœur</strong> &#8211; Located on a hill the area is nice to wander. As with most areas in Paris we spent some time in a cafe to give the kids a break.</li>



<li>The Seine &#8211; We had an enjoyable afternoon just wandering the banks of the Seine. There were a number of small playgrounds along the banks that the kids really enjoyed. With the backdrop of the river, benches and small playgrounds it was the perfect way to spend half a day.</li>



<li>Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris &#8211; We were lucky to visit before the fire. A must see when open.</li>



<li>Wander the city &#8211; We love to wander cities and Paris is no exception. We enjoyed exploring the different districts or Arrondissements. We enjoyed the Latin quarter as well as the Champs-Élysées from the the Arc de Triomphe to the Tuileries Garden.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chamonix</h2>



<p>Getting from Paris to Chamonix was supposed to be simple but for us it was was an adventure. Our train broke down on the way from Paris to Geneva. By the time we realized that car rental office at the train station might not be open (it was a Saturday) it was already closed. After some time on the phone we did locate another rental vehicle at the airport. We were originally supposed to pick up the vehicle at the train station. Due to the delays it was dark when we arrived in Chamonix and thankfully we were able to find our vacation rental in Valorcine.</p>



<p>We had not realized the beauty of the Chamonix valley until we got up the morning after arriving. Our vacation rental was surrounded by snow capped peaks and the air was crisp and clear. We immediately felt at home. Chamonix is a world renowned ski destination and we were visiting in the summer. There was no shortage of activity in the summer though. The ski towns were quant and quiet but still had open restaurants and shops. The mountains could be explored via the many trails and Mont Blanc was accessible via a gondola. Italy could be accessed through the Mont Blanc tunnel. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hiking &#8211; There are numerous trails that can be accessed via the valley floor. Depending on your ability and fitness the trails can bring you right to mountain peaks, and certainly into alpine areas. We tried to hike most days since it was a great way to see the area and get exercise. In retrospect this was the beginning of our love for mountain hikes/treks.</li>



<li>Mont Blanc/Aiguille du Midi &#8211;  Aiguille du Midi, a peak in the Mont Blanc Massif, can be accessed via a Gondola. It&#8217;s a harrowing ride if you&#8217;re not used to heights but well worth it. At the top you&#8217;re in a snow capped area with views of glaciers and the valley below. </li>



<li>Italy &#8211; We took a day trip through the Mont Blanc tunnel to the Aosta valley in Italy. It was a nice day trip for us and we wandered through some villages on the other side of the tunnel.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magic Moment</h2>



<p>The Chamonix valley was the highlight of this trip. The magic moment of the week is taking the Gondola to the Aiguille du Midi. It was a harrowing trip up the Gondola since GMac and Daughter #2 don&#8217;t do as well with heights. The views from the Aiguille du Midi were amazing and well worth the ride.</p>
