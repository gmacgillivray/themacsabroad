                        <p>The kids spend a few weeks away at camp each summer, at least they did during their early
                            teenage years. It was a an awesome experience for them and a great time for us as well. In
                            the summer of 2017 we decided to take a more adventurous trip and check out some eastern
                            European countries. We put together a week trip including Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech
                            Republic. As with most of our trips we tried to get off the beaten path and use public forms
                            of transportation which led to some interesting trip experiences.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Planning</h2>



                        <p>As with many of our other trips we anchored this one around our start and end points. We had
                            heard many great things about Budapest so that was a must for us and our starting point. We
                            also had never been to Prague and was another must visit so that defined our ending point.
                            With those two anchors we set out planning the itinerary. The most common itineraries that
                            include those cities also include Vienna or Brataslava. It makes a lot of sense when you
                            look at the map.</p>

                        </figure>



                        <p>That route, however, looked too much to be the beaten path. In researching the area we were
                            drawn to two other areas, circled in red in the above map. The first was Eger which is a
                            wine region within Hungary known for &#8216;Bull&#8217;s Blood&#8217; wine. More wine is
                            always more better so that attracted our attention. The second was a mountain range called
                            the Tatras which is just north of Poprad on the map. The prospect of some mountain hiking in
                            Slovakia further drew our attention. Of course these areas were not the most efficient way
                            to get between our start and end points. They likely would add an element of complication to
                            our planning which increased our interest in the route. </p>



                        <p>After researching we booked our accommodations in Budapest (3 nights), Tatras (3 nights) and
                            Prague (3 nights). Our flights took us direct into Budapest and home from Prague. </p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Budapest</h2>



                        <p>We loved Budapest. It&#8217;s a city with a rich history that offers visitors some great
                            dining, historical sites and some cool cultural experiences. The city itself is split by the
                            Danube river, the right bank is the Buda side while the left side is Pest. Previously these
                            were separate towns which combined make Budapest. The city is very walkable, especially
                            around the downtown core and we got lots of steps in. The highlights for us included the
                            following areas.</p>



                        <ul class="wp-block-list">
                            <li>Castle Hill &#8211; Located on the Buda side Castle Hill features the Buda Castle and
                                Fisherman&#8217;s Bastion. There is an old town there with shops and restaurants. Great
                                views over the river and the rest of the city.</li>
                            <li>Hungarian Parliament Buildings &#8211; Guided tours are available for the buildings
                                which we found interesting.</li>
                            <li>Wandering the City Core &#8211; We wandered a lot within the city and found lots of neat
                                areas and parks to walk through. </li>
                            <li>Baths &#8211; Budapest has a number of public bath houses that take advantage of natural
                                thermal waters. We spent most of a day at the <a
                                    href="https://www.szechenyibath.hu/">Szechenyi Baths</a>. The water was warm and
                                although it was busy we had a relaxing day. </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Ruin Bar &#8211; One of our coolest experiences in the city was going to a Ruin bar.
                                Ruin bars sprung up as a result of gentrifying urban decay of the city’s 7th District.
                                These eclectic and cobbled together spaces quite literally hijack ruins including
                                abandoned warehouses, empty parking lots, historic buildings. We spent an evening at <a
                                    href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g274887-d668397-Reviews-Szimpla_Kert-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html">Szimpla
                                    Kert</a>. While we&#8217;ve read it&#8217;s more of a tourist attraction now it was
                                a lot of fun. I&#8217;m sure you can find a list of ruin bars to visit with some
                                searching.</li>

                        <p></p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Eger</h2>



                        <p>Eger is a short day trip from Budapest. It&#8217;s about a 2-hour train ride and there are
                            trains that depart regularly. The central tourist spot is the Valley of the Beautiful Women
                            which has a number of wine stores and restaurants. It&#8217;s a quant area and a nice place
                            to wander. The featured wine in the area is Egri Bikaver or Bull&#8217;s Blood. We wandered
                            around the valley for a few hours as well as the town. In our wandering we found the <a
                                href="https://kovacsnimrodwinery.com/winery/">Kovacs Nimrod </a> winery and did a
                            tasting there. </p>



                        <p>From Eger we then continued on towards the High Tatras which is a mountain range in Northern
                            Slovakia. Getting there from Eger was one of the more challenging and interesting aspects of
                            our trip. We needed to take a combination of buses and a train to get there via Miskolc,
                            Kosice and then Poprad. Eger to Miskolc was easy but then the bus we needed to get at
                            Miskolc was late, really late. We also bought tickets online and couldn&#8217;t be certain
                            if we got tickets for the right bus. After some hours of waiting the bus arrived, our
                            tickets were good and we set off. However, our train connection in Kosice was tight. When we
                            finally got to Kosice we sprinted to the platform only to find, in a good way, the train was
                            also late leaving. All good and we finally could relax on the train. </p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">High Tatras</h2>



                        <p>We had never heard of the High Tatras mountain range before and did not know what to expect.
                            It&#8217;s a mountain range that lies in the northern part of Slovakia and southern part of
                            Poland. We recognized quickly the feel of a European ski area. There are a series of small
                            villages at the base of the mountain connected by road and train system. The villages
                            include Tatranska Lomnica, Vysoka Tatry and Strbske Pleso amongst others. </p>



                        <p>When in the mountains during the summer we hike and the High Tatras didn&#8217;t disappoint.
                            The hiking trails were easily accessible from the villages and the train system allowed us
                            to easily get around without a car. We did two full day hikes. The first day was more casual
                            but we pushed it the second day. The second day&#8217;s hike culminated in a climb to a pass
                            using anchored steel chains. Going up was relatively easy but coming down was painful and
                            our feet were incredibly sore at the end of the day. The beer and goulash we had after the
                            hike was done was very satisfying.</p>

                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prague</h2>



                        <p>We were excited to see Prague albeit it was the end of our trip. We had heard so many great
                            things about the city and had read a lot about it. The sites lived up to expectations but if
                            we&#8217;re being honest the city was overrun with tourists and we were constantly in
                            crowds. We felt like we were ten years too late to the city, it was on the beaten path.
                            We&#8217;d still recommend going but think it would be a better experience in shoulder or
                            even off season. </p>



                        <p>We hit the major highlights while in the city and had some great meals. The city really has a
                            great feel and would have been awesome without all the people. Some of the highlights we
                            visited that you&#8217;ll find in most tour books include:</p>



                        <ul class="wp-block-list">
                            <li>Prague Castle and St. Vitus Cathedral &#8211; Huge castle with impressive architecture.
                                Well worth touring the area.</li>
                            <li>Old Town Square &#8211; European old town square with the world&#8217;s oldest operating
                                astronomical clock.</li>
                            <li>Charles Bridge &#8211; Visit the bridge first thing in the morning if you&#8217;re
                                looking to avoid the crowds. Otherwise it&#8217;s a very busy place. Great views of the
                                Vltava river. </li>
                            <li></li>
                            <li>Great food &#8211; We found some great cuisine in the city, it was probably the best
                                part of our visit.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magic Moment</h2>



                        <p>We still to this day smile when we recall our high Tatras hike. We were enjoying the hike so
                            much that we kept pushing higher to get to a mountain pass. We weren&#8217;t disappointed as
                            the last stretch to the pass involved some scrambling and some anchored steel chains. Here
                            Cmac is skillfully navigating the scramble. The hike featured some incredible mountain &amp;
                            valley views. It was a very tiring day and at the end our feet were in bad shape.
                            Nevertheless it&#8217;s a day that stands out in all of our travels.</p>
