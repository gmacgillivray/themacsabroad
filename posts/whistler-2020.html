                        <p>At the time we didn’t know it but this was the last trip we took before the COVID-19 pandemic
                            lock downs started. It was our second trip to <a href="https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/"
                                data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/">Whistler-Blackcomb</a> and
                            we loved it just as much this time as the first. Whistler suits us well as a family, GMac
                            and the kids can get around most of the mountain while CMac prefers more moderate terrain.
                            There is ample supply of both intermediate and advanced terrain on the two mountains. The
                            village is a great size and features a good selection of restaurants and shops, this is key
                            for CMAC. The trip was 10 days total with 8 days of skiing. As with any second trips to the
                            same location we were a little wiser this time. </p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting There</h2>



                        <p>We flew into Vancouver International Airport (YVR), there are lots of flights from within
                            Canada to Vancouver so we had lots of options to get there. We took the bus last time,
                            it&#8217;s more economical but it wasn&#8217;t very convenient so we rented a car to get us
                            there this time. Daughter#1 was preparing to start University in September so we stopped by
                            at the University of British Columbia before setting off to the mountain. While in Vancouver
                            we also picked up an initial load of groceries, groceries at Whistler are a little more
                            expensive so this saved us a few dollars.</p>



                        <p>You&#8217;ll need to drive through the city to get on Hwy 99 to Whistler. Getting through the
                            city isn&#8217;t overly difficult but depending on time of day you&#8217;ll face rush hour
                            traffic, especially when crossing the bridge to West Vancouver. Once on Hwy 99 it&#8217;s
                            not complicated direction wise, you&#8217;ll stay on the Hwy until you get to Whistler.
                            However, the road has lots of twists and turns as well as elevation changes. We recommend
                            that you travel during the daylight if you&#8217;re going for the first time. Budget about 2
                            hours or so if you&#8217;re not making stops.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accomodations</h2>



                        <p>We rented a condo this time since we wanted some more space and wanted to try a different
                            location on the mountain. The major areas to stay include:</p>



                        <ul class="wp-block-list">
                            <li>Creekside &#8211; About a 5 mins drive from the village. You can load the mountain here
                                and accomodations, at least from our pricing are a little cheaper.</li>
                            <li>Village &#8211; We stayed in a village hotel the first time. You&#8217;re in the action
                                and it&#8217;s very convenient. </li>
                            <li>Village North &#8211; Still part of the village but a little further away from the
                                Whistler base lifts. Still very convenient.</li>
                            <li>Upper Village &#8211; Located near the Blackcomb base lifts. </li>
                            <li>Benchlands &#8211; Residences above the Upper Village (This is where Painted Cliff Road
                                is found). Quieter and amongst the trees, ski in and ski out available. Bus access to
                                the village, or a little longer walk.</li>
                        </ul>



                        <p>We used Airbnb to find a spot on Blackcomb mountain off Painted Cliff Road. We weren&#8217;t
                            as careful on the the first dates we picked and GMac missed a work conflict. Thankfully the
                            Airbnb was managed by <a href="https://whistlerplatinum.com/" data-type="URL"
                                data-id="https://whistlerplatinum.com/">Whistler Platinum</a> and they were able to
                            switch the dates for us. The location was excellent for us. We were right on the hill and
                            could ski in/out onto Blackcomb mountain. The condo was a little distance from the village
                            but buses run regularly so it was easy to get to the village and back. CMac and GMac called
                            out &#8216;Bus&#8217; everytime one went by the condo which drove the kids crazy but was
                            endless fun for us. We could walk to the village but only did so twice. The condo itself had
                            two bedrooms and was a perfect size for us. The kids had a room with two single beds and we
                            had a room with a queen bed. The kitchen and living area were a good size.</p>



                        <p>In addition to shops and restaurants the village has grocerie and liquor stores. It was easy
                            to augment our food and beverage supplies during the week. We had breakfast every day in the
                            condo, made basic lunches for the hill and made support every second night. On alternate
                            nites we went into the village to eat at a restaurant.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skiing</h2>



                        <p>We tried to get on the hill before 9am each day. The lifts open at 8:30am but we didn&#8217;t
                            want to rush every morning. Last time we were at Whistler we got onto the hill most days
                            using the Whistler Village Gondola. Since we were on Blackcomb we loaded each morning on the
                            Blackcomb Gondola. Over the course of the week we grew to prefer loading on Blackcomb but we
                            didn&#8217;t have strong feelings on the matter. Both Gondolas get you to mid mountain and
                            you can use the Peak-to-Peak Express to cross mountains. It was also easy to get back to our
                            condo regardless of which mountain we ended the day at.</p>



                        <p>We are by no means experts on Whistler-Blackcomb. In planning for the trip we researched
                            different sites that can provide much better advice than we can. Some of the sites we found
                            helpful are listed below:</p>

                        <p>All we can do is share our experience. As mentioned above CMac is an intermediate skier who
                            likes the blues. The kids and GMac are more advanced and can handle, at appropriate levels
                            of caution, most of the terrain on the two mountains. Due to the difference in skill level
                            we spent some time each day as a family skiing with GMac and the kids sneaking in some of
                            the more advanced terrain in spots. Whistler-Blackcomb features an incredibly diverse
                            selection of terrain and it will take you a full weak to explore most, not all, of it. Here
                            is a snap shot pf some of our favourites spots.</p>



                        <p><strong>7th Heaven</strong> &#8211; If we had to pick one spot, and there are many, on the
                            two mountains this would be our favourite. It&#8217;s tucked on the side of Blackcomb facing
                            Whistler. There are four main groomed blue runs that split their time above and below the
                            tree line. It&#8217;s a great area for us since CMac can cruise on the runs while the kids
                            and GMac can either cruise the run or jump and play in some of the snow off piste. Our
                            favourite hut, the <a
                                href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154948-d704981-Reviews-Horstman_Hut-Whistler_British_Columbia.html">Horstman
                                Hut</a>, is also there so CMac can relax while GMac the kids get a couple of fast runs
                            in.</p>

                        <p><strong>Harmony Express </strong>&#8211; Located opposite 7th Heaven on Whistler mountain
                            this area we find similar to 7th Heaven. The main run, Harmony Piste, is great for CMac.
                            It&#8217;s a groomed run that winds through a wide bowl. There are more advanced runs that
                            drop in to Harmony Piste from Harmony Ridge which GMac and the kids love, especially on
                            fresh powder days.</p>



                        <p>Spanky&#8217;s Ladder (Garnet, Diamond, Ruby and Saphire Bowls) &#8211; This is GMac&#8217;s
                            and the kids favourite area. It&#8217;s more advanced and we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it for
                            beginner or intermediate skiers. You can access this area off the Glacier Express lift but
                            it does require a little hike up to a ridge, hence the name Spanky&#8217;s Ladder. The hike
                            is well worth it as it gets you access to four massive bowls that end on the Blackcomb
                            Glacier. On fresh powder days these bowls are amazing. Even after a few days after fresh
                            snow they are still very enjoyable. The views from the ridge are incredible as well.</p>

                        <p><strong>Flute Bowl</strong> &#8211; The Flute bowl is on Whistler and can be accessed from
                            the Symphony Express, you&#8217;ll need to work your way across Whistler to get there.
                            It&#8217;s a good area for all of us as it features some nice open Blue Runs but also the
                            Flute bowl which we all like. It&#8217;s not as challenging as the terrain off
                            Spanky&#8217;s ladder but we&#8217;ve had some great powder runs there. The bowl itself
                            empties into some glades which are fun to play in.</p>



                        <p>We&#8217;ve also read great things about the advanced terrain around the Whistler bowl. For
                            some reason we haven&#8217;t skied there as much and when we did it was pretty skied out.
                            Something to check out on a subsequent trip.</p>



                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magic Memory</h2>



                        <p>Every trip we take usually has at least one or more experiences that stand out. This trip had
                            a few, GMac loved Spanky&#8217;s ladder and couldn&#8217;t get enough as one example.
                            However, the one family memory was one of our last runs. We timed it so we got one of the
                            last chairs to the top of Whistler peak. It was a gorgeous day and we spent some time at the
                            peak getting pictures. The mountain was clear of the clouds and one of our favourite shots
                            is the picture for this post. We then took our time coming down the mountain got some great
                            pictures. We first made our way from the peak over to Harmony piste, it took a little bit of
                            walking so be warned. However, when we made it to Harmony piste the mountain was empty. It
                            felt like we were the only ones on the mountain. We took our time coming down, enjoying the
                            day and skiing as a group. It was only when we hit mid-mountain that we started to see other
                            skiers emptying for the day. All in all it took us over 45mins to come down to the base but
                            it was a magic memory.</p>

                    <p>At the time we didn’t know it but this was the last trip we took before the COVID-19 pandemic
                        lock downs started. It was our second trip to <a href="https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/"
                            data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/">Whistler-Blackcomb</a> and we
                        loved it just as much this time as the first. Whistler suits us well as a family, GMac and the
                        kids can get around most of the mountain while CMac prefers more moderate terrain. There is
                        ample supply of both intermediate and advanced terrain on the two mountains. The village is a
                        great size and features a good selection of restaurants and shops, this is key for CMAC. The
                        trip was 10 days total with 8 days of skiing. As with any second trips to the same location we
                        were a little wiser this time. </p>



                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting There</h2>



                    <p>We flew into Vancouver International Airport (YVR), there are lots of flights from within Canada
                        to Vancouver so we had lots of options to get there. We took the bus last time, it&#8217;s more
                        economical but it wasn&#8217;t very convenient so we rented a car to get us there this time.
                        Daughter#1 was preparing to start University in September so we stopped by at the University of
                        British Columbia before setting off to the mountain. While in Vancouver we also picked up an
                        initial load of groceries, groceries at Whistler are a little more expensive so this saved us a
                        few dollars.</p>



                    <p>You&#8217;ll need to drive through the city to get on Hwy 99 to Whistler. Getting through the
                        city isn&#8217;t overly difficult but depending on time of day you&#8217;ll face rush hour
                        traffic, especially when crossing the bridge to West Vancouver. Once on Hwy 99 it&#8217;s not
                        complicated direction wise, you&#8217;ll stay on the Hwy until you get to Whistler. However, the
                        road has lots of twists and turns as well as elevation changes. We recommend that you travel
                        during the daylight if you&#8217;re going for the first time. Budget about 2 hours or so if
                        you&#8217;re not making stops.</p>



                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accomodations</h2>



                    <p>We rented a condo this time since we wanted some more space and wanted to try a different
                        location on the mountain. The major areas to stay include:</p>



                    <ul class="wp-block-list">
                        <li>Creekside &#8211; About a 5 mins drive from the village. You can load the mountain here and
                            accomodations, at least from our pricing are a little cheaper.</li>
                        <li>Village &#8211; We stayed in a village hotel the first time. You&#8217;re in the action and
                            it&#8217;s very convenient. </li>
                        <li>Village North &#8211; Still part of the village but a little further away from the Whistler
                            base lifts. Still very convenient.</li>
                        <li>Upper Village &#8211; Located near the Blackcomb base lifts. </li>
                        <li>Benchlands &#8211; Residences above the Upper Village (This is where Painted Cliff Road is
                            found). Quieter and amongst the trees, ski in and ski out available. Bus access to the
                            village, or a little longer walk.</li>
                    </ul>



                    <p>We used Airbnb to find a spot on Blackcomb mountain off Painted Cliff Road. We weren&#8217;t as
                        careful on the the first dates we picked and GMac missed a work conflict. Thankfully the Airbnb
                        was managed by <a href="https://whistlerplatinum.com/" data-type="URL"
                            data-id="https://whistlerplatinum.com/">Whistler Platinum</a> and they were able to switch
                        the dates for us. The location was excellent for us. We were right on the hill and could ski
                        in/out onto Blackcomb mountain. The condo was a little distance from the village but buses run
                        regularly so it was easy to get to the village and back. CMac and GMac called out
                        &#8216;Bus&#8217; everytime one went by the condo which drove the kids crazy but was endless fun
                        for us. We could walk to the village but only did so twice. The condo itself had two bedrooms
                        and was a perfect size for us. The kids had a room with two single beds and we had a room with a
                        queen bed. The kitchen and living area were a good size.</p>



                    <p>In addition to shops and restaurants the village has grocerie and liquor stores. It was easy to
                        augment our food and beverage supplies during the week. We had breakfast every day in the condo,
                        made basic lunches for the hill and made support every second night. On alternate nites we went
                        into the village to eat at a restaurant.</p>



                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skiing</h2>



                    <p>We tried to get on the hill before 9am each day. The lifts open at 8:30am but we didn&#8217;t
                        want to rush every morning. Last time we were at Whistler we got onto the hill most days using
                        the Whistler Village Gondola. Since we were on Blackcomb we loaded each morning on the Blackcomb
                        Gondola. Over the course of the week we grew to prefer loading on Blackcomb but we didn&#8217;t
                        have strong feelings on the matter. Both Gondolas get you to mid mountain and you can use the
                        Peak-to-Peak Express to cross mountains. It was also easy to get back to our condo regardless of
                        which mountain we ended the day at.</p>



                    <p>We are by no means experts on Whistler-Blackcomb. In planning for the trip we researched
                        different sites that can provide much better advice than we can. Some of the sites we found
                        helpful are listed below:</p>

                    </ul>



                    <p>All we can do is share our experience. As mentioned above CMac is an intermediate skier who likes
                        the blues. The kids and GMac are more advanced and can handle, at appropriate levels of caution,
                        most of the terrain on the two mountains. Due to the difference in skill level we spent some
                        time each day as a family skiing with GMac and the kids sneaking in some of the more advanced
                        terrain in spots. Whistler-Blackcomb features an incredibly diverse selection of terrain and it
                        will take you a full weak to explore most, not all, of it. Here is a snap shot pf some of our
                        favourites spots.</p>



                    <p><strong>7th Heaven</strong> &#8211; If we had to pick one spot, and there are many, on the two
                        mountains this would be our favourite. It&#8217;s tucked on the side of Blackcomb facing
                        Whistler. There are four main groomed blue runs that split their time above and below the tree
                        line. It&#8217;s a great area for us since CMac can cruise on the runs while the kids and GMac
                        can either cruise the run or jump and play in some of the snow off piste. Our favourite hut, the
                        <a
                            href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154948-d704981-Reviews-Horstman_Hut-Whistler_British_Columbia.html">Horstman
                            Hut</a>, is also there so CMac can relax while GMac the kids get a couple of fast runs in.

                    <p><strong>Harmony Express </strong>&#8211; Located opposite 7th Heaven on Whistler mountain this
                        area we find similar to 7th Heaven. The main run, Harmony Piste, is great for CMac. It&#8217;s a
                        groomed run that winds through a wide bowl. There are more advanced runs that drop in to Harmony
                        Piste from Harmony Ridge which GMac and the kids love, especially on fresh powder days.</p>



                    <p>Spanky&#8217;s Ladder (Garnet, Diamond, Ruby and Saphire Bowls) &#8211; This is GMac&#8217;s and
                        the kids favourite area. It&#8217;s more advanced and we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it for
                        beginner or intermediate skiers. You can access this area off the Glacier Express lift but it
                        does require a little hike up to a ridge, hence the name Spanky&#8217;s Ladder. The hike is well
                        worth it as it gets you access to four massive bowls that end on the Blackcomb Glacier. On fresh
                        powder days these bowls are amazing. Even after a few days after fresh snow they are still very
                        enjoyable. The views from the ridge are incredible as well.</p>

                    <p><strong>Flute Bowl</strong> &#8211; The Flute bowl is on Whistler and can be accessed from the

                        good area for all of us as it features some nice open Blue Runs but also the Flute bowl which we
                        all like. It&#8217;s not as challenging as the terrain off Spanky&#8217;s ladder but we&#8217;ve
                        had some great powder runs there. The bowl itself empties into some glades which are fun to play
                        in.</p>



                    <p>We&#8217;ve also read great things about the advanced terrain around the Whistler bowl. For some
                        reason we haven&#8217;t skied there as much and when we did it was pretty skied out. Something
                        to check out on a subsequent trip.</p>



                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magic Memory</h2>



                    <p>Every trip we take usually has at least one or more experiences that stand out. This trip had a
                        few, GMac loved Spanky&#8217;s ladder and couldn&#8217;t get enough as one example. However, the
                        one family memory was one of our last runs. We timed it so we got one of the last chairs to the
                        top of Whistler peak. It was a gorgeous day and we spent some time at the peak getting pictures.
                        The mountain was clear of the clouds and one of our favourite shots is the picture for this
                        post. We then took our time coming down the mountain got some great pictures. We first made our
                        way from the peak over to Harmony piste, it took a little bit of walking so be warned. However,
                        when we made it to Harmony piste the mountain was empty. It felt like we were the only ones on
                        the mountain. We took our time coming down, enjoying the day and skiing as a group. It was only
                        when we hit mid-mountain that we started to see other skiers emptying for the day. All in all it
                        took us over 45mins to come down to the base but it was a magic memory.</p>
